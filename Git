1.pip install requests

2.pip install python-firebase

3.After installation you need to open Firebase Console and create a new project and create your firebase project.

So now this is the code for 

#Inserting data to Firebase Real Time database 
CODE:-
		from firebase import firebase 
		firebase = firebase.FirebaseApplication('URL of Database', None)
		data =  { 'Username':'xyz',
			'Email:'xyz@gmail.com',
			'phno':2431232,
			'city':'ABC',
			'country':'PQR'
				  }
		result = firebase.post('authentication details for database /name of table/',data)
		print(result)
 

OK now in this line of code FirebaseApplication takes two parameters; one is URL of database and second is authentication details for database

because for this project we have not set a rule by this reason we have given None in the second parameter.

firebase = firebase.FirebaseApplication('URL of Database', None)

And in this line of code we are going to insert data to our table
result = firebase.post('authentication details for database /name of table/',data)
 
This was for inserting data.
 
And now to retrieve the data,  you can use this code

#Retrieving The Data 

CODE:-
		from firebase import firebase
		firebase = firebase.FirebaseApplication('URL of database', None)
		result = firebase.get('authentication details for database /name of table/', '')
		print(result)

And now to retrieve the data,  you can use this code

#Updating The Data

CODE:-
		from firebase import firebase
		firebase = firebase.FirebaseApplication('Database URL', None)
		firebase.put('/python-example-f6d0b/Students/-LjLUhaWGuxNd5gOEmse','Name','Bob')
		print('Record Updated')
